### MYO AND LINUX

This python script is an example of how to use myo under linux until linux is
(hopefully someday) supported.

### Requirements

Host Windows machine running at the same time (Virtual or Real doesn't matter),
I used a virtual one

ssh server on the windows machine to pass through port 10138 from localhost
(since it is only reachable through localhost).

A linux box

### INSTALLATION

Make sure you have the requirements, then adjust the ip_address in the script
(for ssh and the websocket), run it from the linux side and it should work!
